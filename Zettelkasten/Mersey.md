Mersey is a small frontier town, the one furthest-most to the West. It has routes to the major city of [Copperberg](Copperberg.md) and the [Lilac](Lilac.md), but none are major routes and no trains pass into the town. This makes Mersey perhaps one of the most quiet places in all of the States. A low population, but a population none-the-less of 87 inhabitants. In its heyday, this fine place had an occupancy of 2k people when it was first built, but the growth of the Industry in Copperberg and the original gold boom took people far from Mersey, off to the River Bend and down the Oregon Trail. Those who live there now are the elders who stayed behind and a few young families who chose to keep this place their home.
