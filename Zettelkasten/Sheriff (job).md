# Sheriff

You don’t start as a Sheriff, more likely as a deputy or a Lawmaker of some kind. Your duty is to enforce the law and protect the people. Whose laws? Well, that’s a whole other thing. See, a Sheriff doesn't have to be the most morally sound of people… why should they love you when they can fear you?

Morality and the town’s Goodwill towards you are two highly important stats that determine most of your abilities. If high morality, you can earn extra pay and are able to invest your pay into the Town Fund. If morality is low morality, you can use fear to lower Goodwill but in return get an immediate payout.

At **Level 1**, you gain the ability Quickdraw which is used in the Duelling system. Your Quickdraw modifier is the same as your Spellcasting Modifier - or if you don’t spellcast, your Dexterity modifier. 

**Quickdraw** - In a duel, you may add your Quickdraw modifier to the initial draw roll.

At **Level 3**, you gain the ability to imbue 8 bullets with justice. Justice Bullets must be declared before fired and have an additional +5 to hit on top of all other modifiers. They deal an additional 1d6 damage. You regain 1d4+1 Justice Bullets per short rest.

At **Level 5**, your bullets are increased to 2d6 and you can hold up to 10 shots. In addition, You are able to use your Charisma to help you in certain situations. If you have positive morality, you gain expertise in Persuasion. If negative, you gain expertise in Deception. If neutral, you gain proficiency in both.

At **Level 8**, you are able to use your badge to gain entry to any building within Mersey. If it is a public building, you can access it at any time during the day, but private buildings can only be accessed during day times.

At **Level 10**, your morality comes to the forefront. You gain additional hit points equal to any positive morality you have. If you have negative morality, you instead deal additional necrotic damage on all attacks equal to this morality. While your morality is positive, you are also able to cast Zone of Truth once per day. While negative, you can cast Darkness.

At **Level 12**, your bullets are now 4d8 and can hold up to 12 shots. If you use two justice bullets in the same turn, your Max Fire is increased by 2 with whatever gun you are using.

At **Level 20**, you regain all your bullets on a short rest and all shots are +10 with the justice bullets.
