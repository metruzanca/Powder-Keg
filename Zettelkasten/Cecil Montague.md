# Cecil Montague
![](_attachments/cecil-montague.png)

One of the newest Contractors and Fixers operating out of the valleys.

Hailing from a family of wealth, Cecil is rather trustworthy as he uses his ample funds to try to provide help for the area and those within it.

He operates from his family Manor, the [Hillbridge Manor](Hillbridge%20Manor.md), which is located just outside of [Copperberg](Copperberg.md) on a converted plantation.

Cecil's family is against slavery and thus ensures good working conditions as well as pay, to those who live there. (_unsure if "those who live there" are still legally slaves or if the Montaugues have liberated those_)
