## Welcome to the Old West, 1860.

The Frontiers are vast and expansive lands, a contested force between [The Settlers](The%20Settlers.md) and [The Natives](The%20Natives.md) to the areas who fight over land, supplies and livestock. Agreements are often made and “[Sanctuaries](Sanctuary.md)” afforded to the Natives, but most [Americans](The%20Settlers.md) still end up in conflict with the natives in the areas. [Frontier Towns](Frontier%20Towns.md) are established as spots for those Settlers to slowly expand and live in, most of them in the middle of nowhere, only able to survive off the trains and the wagons that bring them the food they need to live. People once headed west for opportunities, but now those people had headed even further afield to the lands of California and along the Oregon Trail on the hunt for gold years ago, leaving the middle of the nation in a strange lux of control between the Mexicans, the Americans and the Native Americans.

Magic has long existed within these parts, powers given by birth, by prayer or by people known as “Contractors” who are powerful beings from lands beyond our own. Native Americans have their own types of arcana known as [Shamanism](Shamanism.md) and [Ritual Magic](Ritual%20Magic.md). Further to this, they have also made plenty of trades with the Americans as time has passed and so have access to many materials such as Firearms, Coffee and better equipment.

1848 saw the end of the [Mexican-American War](Mexican-American%20War.md) and the cession of lands to the US, with many of these lands remaining spanish and latina in culture, others slowly becoming more American in these years passed. However our tale takes place in the fictionalised location of Casa Moren, known to the Americans as the “Many Valley Strait'' where to the South lies Mexican Land, to the North America, but the West is the ‘Unorganized Territory’ or the lands of the Native Americans, across the River Merser, a thick set of Marshands which has always been used as a divider of the territories.

Maybe you’re just passing through. Maybe you were born here and have been longing to get away. Or perhaps there’s something else that drove you to this sleepy little town. None of that matters now. Welcome to Mersey.

## Your Job in Mersey

![Jobs](Jobs.md)

As the DM, I will work with you to figure out which job suits your story, but some jobs are limited to only one player, other jobs are more lenient. If you do not come from Mersey, your job will be given to you later in the tale but you still may gain the benefits of the job.
