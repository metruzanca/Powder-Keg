# Gambler/Fortune Teller

Care to take a spin? Or perhaps cards are more your game? Tell you what, let’s bet on some dice! Or perhaps your interest is more in the future, no? Can’t pay with money? Well, perhaps you might pay with your life? Or something even more valuable? Either way… House always wins.

At **Level 1**, you gain proficiency in Persuasion and Deception checks as well as Card Games. You also gain the ability to reroll a Nat 1 you roll once per day at the cost of your next Nat 20 becoming a Nat 19.

At **Level 3**, you gain access to your Astral Deck of cards. These cards are either Tarot Cards or Playing Cards. You must pick and stick with your option, as it impacts your choices ahead of you. These cards are given to you by a force from beyond and may not be benevolent.

At **8th Level**, your ability to reroll is increased. You can re-roll your allies Nat 1s at the cost of your own, but can also re-roll an enemies Nat 20, but in return your next roll of any kind is automatically a Natural 1.

At **10th Level**, you gain a bit of protection from the misfortunes of Luck. You now have Expertise in Deception and gain Proficiency in Sleight of Hand. You gain 2d6 Temporary Hit Points whenever you wake up from a Long Rest. This is increased to 4d6 at 14th Level, and to d8s at 20th Level.

## Path of the Fates (Tarot)

At **Level 3** you gain access to your deck of cards. Using an action, you may pull a card from the deck by rolling a d6. You may do this a number of times equal to your Wisdom Modifier to a minimum of one. You regain all expended uses on a short rest.

| d6  | Effect |
| --- | ------ |
|1 - Sun|Creatures of your choice within 30 feet regain hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier.|
|2 - Moon|Creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Spell Save DC or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn.
|3 - Stars|You regain a use of your Channel Divinity or regain 10 spent Lay on Hands.
|4 - Earth|Choose a creature within 30 feet of you. On their next turn, their weapon deals additional damage of its type equal to your Wisdom Modifier on all attacks that turn.
|5 - Arcana|You regain a Level 1 Spell Slot.
|6 - Void|You can cast either Darkness or Dispel Magic at their lowest level without expending a spell slot.

At **8th Level**, you gain the ability to see the Fortunes before you. You gain access to a Divination Spell of your choice and can cast it once per day without using a spell slot. You also can add your Wisdom Modifier to the Saving Throws you make against Spells.

## Path of Luck (Playing Cards)

At **Level 3** you gain access to 52 cards in a magical deck. This deck replenishes 1d6+1 cards per long rest. When you select this class, pick 3 of the Card Uses below. This is increased to 4 at Level 5, 5 at Level 10 and 6 at Level 14.  

### Card Uses

**Protection** - Increase your AC by 1 for each card expended. Max of 6 AC increased. This lasts 10 minutes.  

**Finer Shot** - Before firing a bullet, you are able to expend a card to imbue the bullet. This will make it deal an extra 1d8 damage of an element type you choose.

**Multi Shot** - Throw a Card into the air and roll a d6. That many cards are expended and in return, you are able to fire that many times with the same attack. You can pick a unique target for each shot, and a target may be shot with multiple shots. Each roll is made unique against the target it is shot upon.

**Lucky Slice** - You are able to imbue your blade with an extra hint of luck in order to slice your opponent for an extra 2d6 damage for each card you invest into the attack. This must be decided before you roll. If the attack misses, you instead gain 1 temp HP for each card expended.

**Another Chance** - You can expend a card in order to re-roll a dice roll made by you or an ally. If the roll fails again, you must discard 5 of your playing cards.

**Illusionist’s Glance** - You treat your deck like a Deck of Illusions and may draw from it using an Action. You cannot draw the same illusion twice - once it has been used, it is unusable again. If you roll an Illusion you have already had before, re-roll. If you re-roll another Illusion you have used before, discard the card.

**Divine Luck** - When you are taken down, you can expend 10 cards to instantly get back up with 1hp, however you are also able to teleport to a safe location within 60ft as chosen by the Dungeon Master. You also gain a Shield of 4 AC until your next turn and your Wisdom Modifier in Temporary HP.
