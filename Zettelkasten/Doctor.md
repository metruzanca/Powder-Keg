People need to remain in the peak of health. That’s easier said than done when you have poisonous snakes, dangerous outlaws and mines that have a higher fatality rate than the plague. But that’s alright! The Doctor earns a healthy commission off of it…

At **1st Level** you gain proficiency in Medicine and gain a Health Pool of 4d8. You can expend these whenever you make a Medicine check to heal the amount rolled. Once a d8 is used, it cannot be used again. All used d8 are regained on a Long Rest.

At **3rd Level** you are able to use multiple d8 on a single target up to your Wisdom Modifier. You also gain an extra usage of any Doctor’s Kit.

At **5th Level** your knowledge of surgery allows you to complete surgical operations equivalent to a Lesser Restoration Spell or a usage of 5 Lay on Hands. This takes you 10 minutes and one of your health pool. Your health pool is now 8d8.

At **8th Level** you are able to pick a subjob to take you further in your career. From now, you must choose to Do No Harm or to be a Surgeon Protector. In addition, you gain expertise in Medicine checks and advantage on Death Saving Throws.

## _Do No Harm_
At **8th Level** your healing pool is changed to 8d10. In addition, once per Short Rest you can ensure that up to your proficiency bonus in dice heal the maximum amount automatically. In addition, you are now able to do surgery equivalent to Greater Restoration which takes 2 hours to complete and uses two of your health pools.

At **12th level** your pool is increased to 12d10. In addition, you can now choose to pacify/non-lethally knock out enemies rather than kill them with any ranged attacks. Any enemy you kill costs double morality. Any enemy put into prison gives double morality.

At **16th Level** you can expend Goodwill to attempt tests/surgical experiments which can grant favour with certain Contractors and provide you more knowledge and roleplay uses.

## _Surgeon Protector_
At 8th Level you can now use your healing pool as a harming pool. When you touch an enemy, you can use your healing dice to instead draw life from them. Roll expended dice. What you roll is damage dealt in Necrotic Damage. Half of this is added to your “Stored Health.”

When you heal an ally with your healing pool, you can add the Stored Health to your roll. This expends stored health. All stored health is lost on a long rest. In addition, you are now able to do surgery equivalent to Greater Restoration which takes 2 hours to complete and uses two of your health pools.

At **12th Level** your pool increases to 10d10. Killing an enemy with your Harming Dice will grant you temporary hit points equal to 10 + Your Wisdom Modifier but will cost you morality. In addition, you can expend all remaining dice when you are knocked unconscious to be brought back with that much health.

At **16th Level** you have surpassed what is expected of a Doctor. When an ally dies - not knocked unconscious, but dies - you can expend all your health dice (all 10d10) to revive them with 1 health. If you do not have your full dice pool, a check must be made that is more difficult the less dice you have. You may attempt this once per character, and it must take place within a day of their death.
