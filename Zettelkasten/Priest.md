# Priest/Father

> [!warning]
> Requires: Holy Spellcaster

The old church bell still rings high in the tower. Services on Sundays often bring in a large crowd. 

Mersey has residents of Catholic, Protestant and Jewish birth, but in a small town like this, everyone makes do with services at the church no matter who undertakes them, as was common at the time. Therefore, the Father is a well respected member of the community.

As a Priest, you are able to petition for Charity. This depends on your Goodwill and Morality, two stats which will increase or decrease as your time with the town goes on.

At **1st Level**, you are able to read Latin and one other language due to your time studying. As a Paladin, When you use Divine Smite, you are able to add your proficiency bonus in d6 to one attack per long rest. As a Cleric, you are able to heal a single time for 5 * proficiency bonus per short rest.

At **3rd Level** you gain access to one extra spell slot as long as you are in positive morality. If your morality is negative, you instead deal an extra 2d8 necrotic damage on all attacks. If you are neutral morality, you gain 10ft movement speed.

At **5th Level** you are able to add your Wisdom Modifier to any damage you deal with a cleric cantrip. 

At **8th Level** you gain the ability to restore someone of a lesser wound or condition as if by Lesser Restoration by spending 10 minutes praying with the patient. However once used, it cannot be attempted again until a long rest. You also gain access to the Beacon of Hope spell as an always-known spell.

At **10th Level** you are able to shield one companion from death. When a companion is on less than 10 health or downed and within 60ft, you can place a beacon upon them to protect them. They gain advantage on death saving throws and you take any damage they would take instead of them. You can only use this once per long rest. At **14th Level** this is increased to two uses.
