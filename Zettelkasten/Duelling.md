## How to Duel
### Step One: Size Up your Opponent
Before you complete your paces, you need to size up your opponent to see who they are and how confident they are for this. Both parties roll an Insight Check. This is reduced by your opponent’s Fearful Aura. Whoever has the higher roll after modifiers goes either first or last on Step Four, by their own choice.

### Step Two: Twenty Paces
> [!Note]
If you are in a **Mexican Standoff**, then please skip to Step Three and include Optional Step Four.

Now, turn and take 20 steps (20ft). Then wait for the sound of the clock… turn… and fire!

If you are [Dishonourable](Dishonourable.md) you may cheat your duel and turn early. If you do so, you gain a Surprise Attack for a normal attack. This will skip the entire duel and turn it into a combat scenario.

Breaking the rule of twenty paces will net you a massive **honour penalty**.

### Step Three: Take Aim
You can now decide where you actually want to target your opponent. Where you aim may have increased or decreased chances to hit as well as different results from where you fire. 

These are all listed below.

| Location | Notes                                                                                                                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Head     | Requires 3 Focus. On hit, the opponent is instantly killed, but are able to get their shot off. You have -8 to hit on this shot.   |
| Hand     | Requires 2 Focys. Disarm the opponent, end the duel non-lethally.                                                                  |
| Leg      | Maim your opponent, see if they yield. If they do not, combat begins.                                                              |
| Chest    | Requires 2 Focus. Deal normal damage to the opponent.                                                                              |
| The Sky  | Throw away your shot, show you mean peace and never wished to harm your opponent. Just know… they don’t have to throw away theirs. |

### Step Four (optional) **The Mexican Standoff** / **Multi Man Duel**
If more than three players are involved in a duel, you must also select which target you fire at in the duel. If you have two weapons, like you do in any good Mexican Standoff, you may select two targets at a roll-to-hit penalty of -3 to both rolls.

#### Type of Draw
You now take it in turns dependent on the Size Up roll to decide if you wish to Focus or to Draw. The mechanic works as such:

Focus: +2 to roll, +2 to damage

Draw: All involved in duel immediately roll initiative. The person who selected “Draw” has +4 to his roll. Each player adds their Quickdraw to this roll.


If all players decide to Focus, then the initiative returns to the top of the order. Focus can be stacked up to Three Times. However, when a player selects “Draw” then immediately the Duel begins as proper.


### Step Five: Rules of Combat
There are rules to a duel, son.
If a maim shot fails, or a chest shot does not cause your opponent to yield, then the duel will become a normal D&D combat scenario using the initiative established in the Draw.
A Natural 20 does not deal crit damage, but instead is able to be used to force disarm your opponent, or to guarantee a hit.
If both players are disarmed, then they may restart the duel or agree to the result of it.
