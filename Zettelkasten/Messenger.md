In a land like this, trains and transport have taken the leadway in getting mail across the country and keeping everyone informed. The age of information is far away, but the world has never felt so large for those living within it.

At **1st Level** you gain proficiency in land vehicles and gain access to Speak with Animals once per long rest, as well as proficiency in Animal Handling. You gain an astral steed, a rideable horse, which you can summon any amount of times. If it dies, it takes 10 minutes for it to be summonable once again.

At **3rd Level** you gain 15ft movement speed. In addition you cannot be Grappled and while mounted are able to use ranged weaponry with no disadvantage and one-handed blade attacks with advantage.
You gain your whip, which you are proficient in. This holds the stats of a usual whip as a weapon, but you are able to restrain your opponents with it with a bonus action. While an opponent is restrained in it you gain 10 hp at the start of your turn.

At **5th Level** you are able to bond with one weapon to you, which you can summon to your hand with a bonus action no matter how far away it is. When you attack with this weapon, you have +2 to hit and +2 to damage.

At **8th Level** you gain a telepathic link with those around you, including your steed. You gain +5 to all your saves and can grant +5 to an allyâ€™s save if they are within 10ft of you. In addition to this, your whip now does double dice.

At **10th Level** your steed gains an additional 10ft movement and you gain +2/+2 to all attacks made while upon its back. On your turn, you can take health from yourself to heal your horse or vice versa. You cannot kill your horse by doing as such. You also gain the ability to change the form of your steed to any other rideable animal including flying animals.

At **12th Level** you gain expertise in Animal Handling and your whip is also able to paralyse all targets if they fail to beat you in a strength/grapple check. This lasts until they are able to beat a DC 16 Strength Saving Throw.
