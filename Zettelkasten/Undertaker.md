# Undertaker

> [!warning]
> Requires: Spellcaster

The Dead have to stay dead. Simple as. As an Undertaker, you serve many important roles. You ensure bodies are buried as per their religion demands to help them pass on, but you also prevent diseases from spreading through your work. But in a land of magic, you may also be called upon to resurrect the dead - or keep them dead for good. Which path you take is up to you

At **1st Level** you gain access to a pool of 10 Lay on Hands, or an increase of 10 if you are already a Paladin. These are not increased by levelling up. You also gain access to the Spare the Dying cantrip for free.

At **3rd Level** you gain access to Rebuke the Undead which grants a pool of 6d8 radiant dice. You may use as many of these dice as you wish up to your proficiency bonus on a hit against any enemy who is of the class “Undead” as long as you are able to hit them with the attack. Half of the max of the pool is regained at a long rest. At 6th Level this increases to 8d8 and at 10th Level your dice become d10. At 12th Level it becomes 10d8 and at 16th it becomes 12d8. At 20th level, you regain all your Undead dice on a long rest and half on a short.

At **5th Level** you unlock Divine Sense with 2 uses. If you are already a Paladin, your Divine Sense is increased by 2 uses. At 12th Level your Divine Sense is enhanced, and you are able to use it to keep track of invisible targets as long as they remain in your plane, and can sense spirits in the Ethereal Plane, but not their location.

At **8th Level** you unlock access to a Wizard Spell of your current highest unlock level which is always known to you. You gain another such spell at 14th level. These spells must be of the Necromancy or Conjuration subclass.

At **10th Level** you make a choice: To Deny the Dead, or to Raise them. You select a Subjob of either “_Necromancer_” or “_Soul Guardian_”
  

## _Soul Guardian_

If you slay a spirit who is Lawful in alignment or Good in alignment, you must carry that spirit with you until the body is buried and rites are said. This spirit can be vengeful, peaceful or wrathful and will communicate to you when in Long Rests. They may attempt to tempt you or break concentration and are overall dangerous to have, but they can also sometimes be helpful and provide boons.

When you slay a spirit of an evil alignment or chaotic alignment, you gain a Soul Token. You can either turn these in for rewards and items with the Voodoo Sellers in the cities or Natives, turn them in to certain Contractors or use them to gain favour with characters, or trade them in for abilities that will reveal themself as the story unfolds.

## _Necromancer_

_See [Judas Priest - Necromancer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNZaTNQmh_U) to get into the right vibe._

When you slay an enemy, you are able to use your Rebuke the Undead hitpoints to revive them as an Undead with a certain amount of hit points matching the amount of dice used to raise them. You can raise any humanoid, beast or monster, but they will only be able to attack if you dedicate an Action to command them to attack a target. Switching targets uses a bonus action. You are able to command multiple/all of your undead forces with one action.

However, if you ever run out of Rebuke the Undead dice, you will feel the curse of death rise on you. It may take no effect or may take a toll depending on a roll made by the DM. The Curse of Death does grant some benefits, including a stronger control over your undead, greater powers and more - but everything comes at a great toll.
