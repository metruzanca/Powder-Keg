Everyone needs a drink and everyone needs to tell a story, and no-one is best to listen and keep secrets than the mind behind the bar. A few stiff drinks and anyone will be revealing their life story to you…

At **1st Level** you gain proficiency in Perception and Insight, as well as in one tool of your choice. You also gain 1 in Quickdraw, which does not increase. In addition to this, you are able to brew drinks and potions as long as you have the equipment for it via your proficiency in Alchemist’s Kit.

At **3rd Level** you are able to press people’s weak points using their fears and secrets against them. If someone has spent time at your bar, you have advantage on Persuasion checks against them.

In addition, you gain access to **Brewer’s Points**. You have 6 of these points and regain them all upon a Long Rest. These points can be expended to gain advantage on any roll or impose disadvantage on any roll for any character within 30ft. You can also use two of these points to stabilise a party member within 10 feet.

At **5th Level** you gain proficiency in improvised weaponry and expertise in Insight. You are able to gain double money on all payments as long as you are in positive Goodwill.

At **8th Level** you can now use your Brewer’s Points to deal an additional 1d8 on any attack, stacking up to 3 points on a single attack. You now have 8 Brewer’s Points.

At **12th Level** you gain an ability to protect yourself by an additional +1 AC and the ability to go down to 1hp rather than 0hp once per long rest.

At **14th Level** you gain an additional 2 Brewer’s Points and can use them to give 10 Temporary HP to yourself or an ally within 30ft. This does not stack.
