-   Colton is apparently gone

-   Raf overpaid by 2.5x (1g instead of 4s)

<!---->

-   The Mayor explains a couple things
-   The [Former Deputy](../Zettelkasten/Former%20Deputy.md) was likely shot by [The Phantoms](../Zettelkasten/The%20Phantoms.md).
-   Cassie was a member of The Phantoms.
-   The leader of the phantoms tried to get with the mayor’s daughter
-   There is a stranger at a table, sipping his drink (does magic)
-   Dallas tries to strike up a conversation
-   The old man talks about a contractor “[Jackson Mercer](../Zettelkasten/Jackson%20Mercer.md)”
> “If you ever want to meet with Jackson Mercer, he will find you”
-   Suddenly the man is gone
-   Likely from Cumberdale


At the Jail:
-   The prisoner starts talking smack immediately
-   Claims he doesn’t care about getting tortured, seems to have been before

-   A stranger enters and diffuses the situation. Seemingly with magic
-   He introduces himself as “[Jackson Mercer](../Zettelkasten/Jackson%20Mercer.md)”

<!---->

-   He’s looking for people to complete a job
-   Needs help reestablishing a supply line for a native village
-   offers information on the murder ([Cassie](../Zettelkasten/Cassie.md)?)

> [Stop The Davies Boys Raiders](../Quests/Stop%20The%20Davies%20Boys%20Raiders.md)

-   Raf and the Mayor talks about the Mercer contract
-   Raf heads to the saloon to talk business with the bois & gals
-   We make plans

<!---->
