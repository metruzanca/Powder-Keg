Raf, Claire and Elisabeth are taking care of an unmarked grave, when they notice footsteps in the sand nearby, leading into a [Unmarked Cave](Unmarked%20Cave.md).

Exploring a sandstone-cave
Writing on the wall: Camp Phoenix 1779
magics are happening
Raf, Claire and Lizzie fight* a door

[D-16](../Zettelkasten/D-16.md) having a flashback
D-16 is introduced, having emerged out of the sand/door in the cave
D-16 and the others have a conversation that helps the warforged catch up on what year and date it is, as well as how things are now

Back in [Mersey](../Zettelkasten/Mersey.md) (at 2-3am):
A couple drunks outside smash a bottle
[Dallas](../Zettelkasten/Dallas%20Delaney.md) gets ready for action
He sees and elven man (Arthur), staggering around drunkenly
he yells for Dallas
“[Samuel](Samuel.md)” sent him
They talk about their past
Dallas reads a letter from his deceased birthmother
leaves it at the table and retreats to his rooms, not speaking to [Bethany](../Zettelkasten/Bethany.md) (who also reads the letter)

Back with the party, we have a conversation and decide to get [D-16](../Zettelkasten/D-16.md) back to [Father Richards](../Zettelkasten/Father%20Richards.md)
We leave them there for the night

A New Morning:
We meet at the Saloon, not too long after sunrise
D-16 is clean and ready for combat
D-16 is much older than they should be. Likely originally made from wood (probably built by natives)
Father Richards tell Elisabeth (and Claire) to take care of them and not let them become a warbot again
Dallas nicknames D-16 “[Ward](../Zettelkasten/D-16.md)”
Raf gets ready to get a car and horses
Not long after we head off

D-16 naming people before learning their names:
[Raf](../Zettelkasten/Rafkoris%20Sunder.md) = [Mr. Cream](../Zettelkasten/Rafkoris%20Sunder.md) (Canon)
